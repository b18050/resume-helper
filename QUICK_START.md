# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Your Workflow (Super Simple!)

Since you're using `main.tex` as your fixed resume, here's your streamlined process:

### 1. Start the App
```bash
cd /Users/chandapr/resume_helper
python3 backend/app.py
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### 2. For Each Job Application:

1. **Enter the company name** (e.g., "Google", "Amazon", "Meta")
2. **Copy the job posting URL** (or paste the job description text)
3. **Paste it** into the "Job description URL" field
4. **Click** "Generate tailored resume"
5. **Download** the PDF: `Chandan_Prakash_Software.pdf`
6. **Submit!** 🎉

That's it! The app:
- ✅ Uses your `main.tex` automatically
- ✅ Extracts keywords from the job posting
- ✅ Adds missing keywords as hidden white text
- ✅ Saves both `.tex` and `.pdf` to `Company_Name/` directory
- ✅ Compiles to PDF with your name
- ✅ Ready to submit in seconds!

**Bonus:** Files are automatically organized by company in the project root:
```
resume_helper/
├── Google/
│   ├── Chandan_Prakash_Software.pdf
│   └── Chandan_Prakash_Software.tex
├── Amazon/
│   ├── Chandan_Prakash_Software.pdf
│   └── Chandan_Prakash_Software.tex
└── Meta/
    ├── Chandan_Prakash_Software.pdf
    └── Chandan_Prakash_Software.tex
```

| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **+2 stars** |

### How to Verify:
```bash
# Test with your actual PDF
python3 verify_keywords_in_pdf.py Chandan_Prakash_Software.pdf

# See ATS simulation

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Optimize Your Keyword Count
- **Tech roles:** 25-30 keywords
- **General roles:** 15-20 keywords
- **Executive roles:** 20-25 keywords

### When to Update main.tex
Only update your base `main.tex` when you:
- Change your actual experience
- Add new projects
- Update contact information

The tool handles job-specific keywords automatically!

### Best Practices
1. ✅ **Read the job posting carefully** - only apply if you're actually qualified
2. ✅ **Let the tool add keywords** for technologies you know but forgot to emphasize
3. ✅ **Don't overthink it** - the tool is designed for your exact workflow
4. ❌ **Don't add skills you don't have** - keywords should match real experience

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port 5000 in use?
```bash
# Kill the process or use a different port
python3 backend/app.py  # Will suggest alternatives
```

### PDF compilation fails?
Check TinyTeX is installed:
```bash
ls ~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/universal-darwin/pdflatex
```

### Keywords not working?
Verify `\usepackage{xcolor}` is in your `main.tex` preamble (the app will warn you).

### Can't scrape a job URL?
- Some sites block scraping → Just paste the job description text instead
- Works perfectly with pasted text!
